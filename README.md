# Critical-Thinking-Project-Source-Code-Management-for-a-Distributed-Development-Team

## Enforce Security Best Practices Projects
As part of this learning project, I implemented several Git security best practices to ensure the integrity and protection of the codebase.

## Objective
I implemented Git security best practices, including:

1. Setting up user access controls
2. Managing SSH keys
3. Enforcing branch protection rules
4. Enabling commit signing
5. Establishing a mechanism for change auditing
## User Access Controls
To manage access to my GitHub repository, I navigated to the Settings tab of my project repository. Under Collaborators and teams, I invited a dummy user as a collaborator.

I assigned the read-only role by selecting Read permission when sending the invite. This ensured the collaborator could view the codebase but couldn't push or merge any changes.

This exercise demonstrated how I could control who has access to my project and the level of access they are granted — an essential part of securing distributed development environments.

### Outcome
This setup ensures that only authorized users can push, merge, or delete branches, safeguarding the codebase from unauthorized or accidental modifications.

## SSH Authentication
I already had SSH keys set up. To verify, I ran:
```
ssh -T git@github.com
```
It returned a message confirming successful authentication. To manage my SSH keys, I did the following:

1. Visited https://github.com/settings/keys
2. Reviewed the list of uploaded keys
3. Ensured my personal machine’s key was added and labeled clearly
4. Removed any outdated or unknown keys
This helped me ensure that only my authorized devices can securely access the repository using SSH.

### Outcome
SSH key authentication provides encrypted communication with GitHub and eliminates the risks of password-based access.

## Enforced Branch Protection
I enabled branch protection rules by:

1. Going to the repository Settings > Branches
2. Clicking Add rule
3. Targeting the main branch
4. Enabling the following:
a. Require pull request reviews before merging
b. Require status checks to pass before merging
c. Require signed commits
d. Restrict who can push to matching branches
This setup prevented unauthorized changes and enforced a clean, verified history on the main codebase.

## Signed Commits for Critical Changes
To ensure commit authenticity, I configured Git to sign all my commits using GPG.

Steps I followed:

1. Verified my GPG key using:
```
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
```
2. Copied my key ID and added it to GitHub via https://github.com/settings/keys
3. Set Git to sign all commits by default:
```
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```
4. Tested with:
```
git commit -S -m "My signed commit"
```
I confirmed on GitHub that my commits were verified, proving their authenticity.
## Change Auditing
Since I enabled branch protection and signed commits, all changes are now traceable. GitHub provides commit history and comparisons, and signed commits help ensure the identity of contributors.

## Summary
By taking these steps:

1. I secured access through collaborator permissions.
2. I verified and managed my SSH keys.
3. I enforced structured development using branch protection rules.
4. I ensured commit authenticity using GPG-signed commits.
5. I enabled traceable auditing with verified commit history.
These practices form a strong foundation for securing any Git-based workflow, especially in collaborative or distributed environments.
