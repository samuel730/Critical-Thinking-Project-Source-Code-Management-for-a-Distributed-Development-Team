# Critical-Thinking-Project-Source-Code-Management-for-a-Distributed-Development-Team

## Author: Oluwatunmise Adesanya

### Overview:

This document provides a complete evaluation and an implementation plan for migrating from a centralized VCS (e.g., SVN) to a distributed VCS (Git). It contains: research and recommendations (Task 1); a Git workflow guide supporting feature branching, pull requests, and integration testing (Task 2); CI/CD implementation using GitHub Actions with example workflow files (Task 3); security best practices and configuration steps (Task 4); and a real-world merge conflict resolution demonstration along with preventative measures (Task 5).
